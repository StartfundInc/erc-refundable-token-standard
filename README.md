# Refundable Token Standard

The value of security token can be total sum of linked currencyâ€™s value. For example, Token Issuing  process, issuer can receive money from  buyers( or investors) and transfers issuing token to buyers. If offering process is successfully completed, there is no issue. But buyers can change their plan, or offering is failed(or canceled) cause of mis-fitting the compliance rules or other rules. There is no way guarantee to payback(refund) to buyer in on-chain network.

We have suggest this process make possible in on-chain network with payable currency like token(ex: USDT)
