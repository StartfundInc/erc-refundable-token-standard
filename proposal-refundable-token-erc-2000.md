## Simple Summary

A standard interface for Refundable Token.

## Abstract

The value of security token can be total sum of linked currencyâ€™s value. For example, Token Issuing  process, issuer can receive money from  buyers( or investors) and transfers issuing token to buyers. If offering process is successfully completed, there is no issue. But buyers can change their plan, or offering is failed(or canceled) cause of mis-fitting the compliance rules or other rules. There is no way guarantee to payback(refund) to buyer in on-chain network.

We have suggest this process make possible in on-chain network with payable currency like token(ex: USDT)


## Motivation

A standard interface allows payable token contract to interact with ERC-2000 interface within smart contracts.

Any payable token contract call ERC-2000 interface to exchange with issuing token based on constraint built in ERC-2000 smart contract to validate transactions.

Note: Refund is only available in certain conditions(ex: period, oracle value etc) based on implementations.

## Requirements

Exchanging tokens, requires having an escrow like standard way in on-chain network.

The following stand interfaces should be provided on ERC-2000 interface.
  - MUST support querying texted based compliance for transactions. ex: period, max number of buyers, minimum and maximum tokens to hold, refund period, etc.
  - exchange(or purchase) with success or failed return code.
  - refund(or cancel transaction) with success or failed return code.
  - withdraw when escrow process has been success.


## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

There are 3 contracts for the escrow process: `Buyer Contract`, `Seller Contract` and `Escrow Contract`.
 - Buyer Contract: Buyers will pay to escrow account to exchange with `Seller Token`.
 - Seller Contract: The seller will pay to escrow account to exchange with `Buyer Token`.
 - Escrow Contract: Will be created by seller. Agent to co-operate between buyers and seller based on constraint rules. Instead of simple address mapped balance variable in ERC20 tokens, this balance should have (Seller, Buyer).

**Every ERC-2000 compliant contract must implement the `ERC2000` interfaces**

```

## Rationale
The standard proposes interfaces on top of the ERC-20 standard.
Each functions should include constraint check logic.
In `escrow-contract`, should implemented internal constraint logic such as period, maximum investors, etc.
The `buyer-contract` and `seller-contract` should not have constraint rules.

Let's discuss following functions.

1. **`constructor`**

In escrow contract, will define success/failure conditions. It means constraint rules might not be changed for ever(might be changed after created for market exchange rate.), so it guarantee escrow policy.

2. **`escrowFund`**

This function should run differently for buyer and seller.

[seller]
- The seller call this function to be escrow-ready. Seller's token ownership(balance) will be transferred to escrow-contract and escrow balance will be (Seller: amount, Buyer: 0).
- The seller can call this function multiple times depends on implementation, but preferred just one time.

[buyer]
- When escrow is in running state(not success or failed), the buyer can call this function to deposit fund into escrow account.
- the escrow balance will be (Seller: amount x exchange-rate, Buyer: amount). The `Buyer: amount` will be used for refund process.
- Once it is success, the seller's escrow balance will be (Seller: -= amount x exchange-rate, Buyer: += amount).

3. **`escrowRefund`**

This function should be invoked by buyers only.
The buyer can call this function in running state only. In state of failed or success, could not be success.
The escrow balances of seller and buyer will be updated reverse way of `escrowFund`


4. **`escrowWithdraw`**

Buyers and seller can withdraw tokens from escrow account to their own account.
The following processes are recommended.
- Buyer can withdraw in escrow-success state only. Ownership of seller tokens can be transferred to buyer from escrow-contract. In escrow-failed state, buyer should call `escrowRefund` function.
- When the seller call this function in escrow-success state, remained seller token will be transferred to seller, and earned buyer's token will be also transferred from escrow-account.
- In case of escrow-failed, seller only get refund seller token.



## Backwards Compatibility

By design ERC-2000 is fully backwards compatible with ERC-20.
