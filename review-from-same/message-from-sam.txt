I've put up StartfundInc#1 with some editorial changes.

Besides those changes, I think this EIP needs some more work before moving to the final state:

1. The difference between the Payable Contract and the Escrow Contract are not clearly explained enough.
  For example, it seems like they both implement IERC5528 but behave differently.

2. There is some ambiguity about whether Escrow Contracts can implement policies beyond the list enumerated in this proposal.
  I'd add a line explicitly either allowing or prohibiting extra policies.

3. The instructions for implementing the Payable Contract's functions are a bit confusing.
  Adding an example Solidity function call to demonstrate
  what you mean by calling the same function in the Escrow Contract with certain parameters would certainly help clear things up.

4. I think I missed replacing _transfer with transfer in a few places ðŸ˜…

5. The Rationale section still has some grammar problems.
6. The section header describing policies is called #### constructor. I'm not sure if you mean to imply that these policies have to be set in the constructor, or if that was a mistake.
